/*! Accelerometer driver interface
 *  ==============================
 *
 * The accelerometer driver is simply an interface to the accelerometer
 * hardware. It is dumb; it does not contain any circular buffers, has no
 * knowledge of clients, threads, subsampling or even other hardware. It is up
 * to higher level code (read: the accelerometer service) to deal with
 * that. The reason for that is to maximize code reuse: anything which could
 * possibly need to be copy-pasted from one accel driver to another should be
 * moved outside of the driver.
 *
 * The accelerometer knows (almost) nothing about the OS, events, analytics or
 * the vibe motor. It does not even keep around a sample buffer for any reason.
 * All of that code is handled externally. The interface for the accelerometer
 * driver is a set of functions implemented by the accelerometer, and a set of
 * external functions that it will call in response to certain events. While OS
 * services may be employed internally by a driver, they are not part of the
 * public interface.
 *
 * One of the goals of the accelerometer interface is to hide the state of the
 * accelerometer hardware as much as possible (e.g. FIFO mode) and use
 * higher-level constructs to allow the driver to make its own decisions on what
 * state the hardware should be in. This way the interface is (hopefully)
 * generic enough that accelerometers with vastly different operating and
 * power-saving modes can have all of those details hidden away in the driver,
 * and the higher-level code can work unmodified with different accelerometers.
