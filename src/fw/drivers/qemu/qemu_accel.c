//! The QEMU accelerometer driver is pretty broken, but it requires
//! a complete overhaul of both the QEMU Serial messages and all senders
//! of those messages (pebble-tool and CloudPebble, via libpebble2) to
//! fix the brokenness. Since it's not a critical feature, the
//! brokenness will stay for the time being.
//!
//! What's broken about it? The protocol is braindead: it doesn't know
//! anything about sample rates. The senders just send a sequence of
//! (x,y,z) tuples with no timing information attached. The driver then
//! plays them back one after the other at whatever sample rate the
//! accel manager happens to request. This means that depending on the
//! sample rates that the samples were recorded and the current
//! configured sample rate, the samples could be replayed anywhere from
//! 10x slower to 10x faster than they were recorded (100 Hz recording
//! with 10 Hz replay, or vice versa).
//!
//! The driver was exceptionally braindead before, buffering up all of
//! the samples it could and replaying them from a 256-sample deep
//! buffer. With a typical replay rate of 25 Hz and samples being
//! recorded at 100 Hz, that results in samples being replayed at 1/4
//! speed with ten second latency. No good.
//!
//! The way libpebble2/pebble-tool/CloudPebble sends accel samples to be
//! replayed is also braindead. It pays no attention to the
//! QemuProtocolAccelResponse messages and just sends samples as soon as
//! they're received. So for replaying samples from the command-line or
//! a file, they're all batched up and sent in a single message. Samples
//! being recorded live from a phone are taken at 100 Hz and sent to
//! QEMU as soon as they are received. By knowing how the protocol is
//! actually used, we can improve the user experience quite
//! significantly, making the driver a bit simpler in the process.
//! Instead of buffering all samples as they are received, throw out and
//! replace the sample buffer every time a new QemuProtocolAccel message
//! is received. Play those back at the driver's current sampling rate,
//! latching the last sample received if the sample buffer underruns.
//! Replaying of prerecorded accelerometer samples e.g. from a file will
//! still play back at the wrong sample rate most of the time, but live
//! replay from a phone will work in realtime with minimal latency
//! without speeding up or slowing down the signal during replay.
