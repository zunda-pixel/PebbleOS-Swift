//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This module is responsible for keeping track of what apps are installed,
// and acts as the abstraction which makes system and third party apps look the same
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//! There are many different representations, structures, and identifiers of an Application within
//! our firmware. This is an attempt to clear up the different types and also to document them.
//!
//! Accessing apps or their metadata
//! ----------------------------------
//! Preferred Methods
//!
//! - AppInstallEntry: Universal struct that contains all metadata for an application no matter
//!                    where it originates from (FW, Resource, Flash)
//! - AppInstallId: A number assigned to an application. Pre-assigned and negative for FW and
//!                 resource applications, assigned on install for Flash applications.
//!
//! Deprecated Methods
//!
//! - Uuid: a 16-byte identifier for an application. Every application process must contain a Uuid,
//!         but it is not a requirement for firmware applications. Should avoid whenever possible.
//!         A Uuid should only be used when in communication with the phone, since the phone should
//!         have no knowledge of AppInstallId's.
//!
//! - PebbleProcessMd: This should only be used when launching an application. No piece of code
//!                    should ask the app_install_manager for a PebbleProcessMd unlesss it plans on
//!                    assisting with the launch of the application (event_loop, app_manager, etc.)
//!
//! How applications are stored
//! ---------------------------
//! Serialized Data Structures
//!
//! - AppDBEntry: The phone sends over this packed data in BlobDB and is stored in flash on the
//!               watch. This data gets deserialized in the AppInstallManager and morphed into an
//!               AppInstallEntry. This structure can't change without agreeing with the phone on
//!               the changes. These entries are assigned an AppInstallId on install.
//!
//! - AppRegistryEntry: Hardcoded metadata for system application that comes packaged with the
//!                     firmware. There are two types: FW and RESOURCE. These entries are assigned
//!                     an AppInstallId by the programmer. Hardcoded and should never change.
//!     - FW:       These are the applications that have hard coded PebbleProcessMd's.
//!     - RESOURCE: These are stored in the System Resource Pack and loaded on demand.
//!
//! Misc Notes
//! ----------
//!
//! If any module wants information about an application, the process is as follows:
//! 1. It should first retrieve an AppInstallId.
//! 2. Call app_install_get_entry_for_install_id and get the entry data structure
//! 3. Use the getter functions for the entry to retrieve individual fields within the struct.

//! Max number of bytes for an application.
