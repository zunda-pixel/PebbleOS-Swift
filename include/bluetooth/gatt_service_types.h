//! Below are the data structures to store information about a *remote* GATT
//! service and its characteristics and descriptors.
//!
//! It's designed for compactness and ease of serialization, at the cost of
//! CPU cycles to iterate over and access the data.
//! The GATTCharacteristic are tacked at the end of the struct. At the end of
//! each GATTCharacteristic, its descriptors are tacked on. Lastly, after all
//! the characteristics, an array of Included Service handles is tacked on.
//! Struct packing is not enabled at the moment, but could be if needed.
//! Handles for the Characteristics and Descriptors are stored as offsets from
//! the parent service handle to save one byte per characteristic.
//!
//! Ideas for more memory footprint optimizations:
//! - Create a shared list of UUIDs that can be referenced,
//! to avoid wasting 16 bytes of RAM per service, characteristic and descriptor?
