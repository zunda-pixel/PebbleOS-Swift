// Design goals of this module:
//
// - Provide a generic mechanism to pass variable-length data from app to kernel service.
// - Have the data be read directly from an app-provided buffer (in app space).
// - Asynchronous: a "sent" callback should execute on the (app) task that created the outbox, when
//   the transfer is completed.
// - Simple status results: the "sent" callback should be called with a simple status code that
//   indicates whether the transfer was successful or not.
// - Use is limited only to the hard-coded set of permitted use cases and their handlers, to avoid
//   abuse of the API by misbehaving apps.
// - The kernel manages the existence of service instances. If data is sent while the service is not
//   registered, the sent_handler should be called right away with a failure.
// - Allow adding a message while there is already one or more waiting in the outbox.
//
// Non-goals:
//
// - Ability to cancel messages that have already been added to the outbox (could be added easily
//   in the future)
