// Design goals of this module:
//
// - Provide a generic mechanism to pass variable-length data from a kernel service to app.
// - Have the data be written directly into an app-provided buffer (in app space).
// - Data is chunked up in "messages".
// - Data must be contiguously stored for easy parsing (no circular buffer wrap-arounds).
// - Support writing a message, while having pending, unconsumed message(s) in the buffer.
// - Support starting to write a partial message, write some more and finally decide to cancel it.
//   The partial message should not get delivered.
// - No race conditions can exist that could cause reading of an incomplete message.
// - Support for notifying the app when data has been dropped (not enough buffer space) and
//   report the number of dropped messages.
//
// Non-goals:
// - Sharing the same buffer between multiple kernel services (1:1 service to buffer relation is OK)
// - Concurrently writing to the inbox from multiple tasks (failing the write up front when another
//   task is currently in the process of writing a message is OK)
// - Preserve the ordering of when the dropped messages happened vs the received messages (it's OK
//   to only report the number of dropped messages)
