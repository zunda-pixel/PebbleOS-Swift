//! Exported APIs for the Pebble File System (PFS)
//!
//! Things to note:
//!  - All APIs are threadsafe
//!  - PFS implements a basic wear-leveling strategy to extend the life of
//!    the flash part
//!  - PFS allows the allocation of blocks of space which appear to the consumer
//!    as a contiguous region. It is up to the consumer to manage how they
//!    want to manage the allocated space
//!  - Assumes underlying HW is a NOR flash chip. This means that when a
//!    0 bit value is written to a given location, the file needs to be erased
//!    or rewritten to change it back to a 1. (pfs_open (i.e OP_FLAG_OVERWRITE)
//!    provides a mechanism that consumers can leverage to accomplish this)
//!  - Erasing flash sectors is a costly operation (from both a time/power
//!    perspective). Care should be taken not to constantly be deleting/creating
//!    files

//! @param name - The name of the file to be opened
//! @param op_flags - The operation to be performed on the file
//!
//!   OP_FLAG_READ - Open a file such that pfs_read operations will work. If the
//!    file does not exist, opening a file with just this mode set will fail
//!
//!   OP_FLAG_WRITE - Creates a file if it does not exist, else opens a file
//!    such that pfs_write operations will work. It is up to the user to seek to
//!    the desired offset within the file
//!
//!   OP_FLAG_OVERWRITE - Provides a safe mechanism to incrementally overwrite
//!    a file that already exists with new data. Open will fail if the file does
//!    not already exist on flash. The changes for the overwritten file are not
//!    committed until the pfs_close is called. Until this time, pfs_open of the
//!    'name' will return a hdl to the original file. This way there is always a
//!    valid version of the file which can be read & the caller can copy parts
//!    of the orginal file in hunks rather than allocating a lot of RAM.
//!
//!   OP_FLAG_SKIP_HDR_CRC_CHECK - For files which are not accessed frequently,
//!    it is a good idea to sanity check the on-flash header CRCs to make sure
//!    nothing has gone astray. This has performance ramifications if you are
//!    doing thousands of opens on the same file so this flags allows consumers
//!    to turn the check off
//!
//!   OP_FLAG_USE_PAGE_CACHE - Turns on caching for the translation from
//!    virtual filesystem pages to their physical address. For large files with
//!    a lot of random access this is advantageous because we need to read
//!    flash bytes to get to the correct page. Ideally this should only be
//!    used for read operations so that heap corruption does not lead to us
//!    corrupting a file
//!
//! The following two parameters are only parsed when a file is
//! overwritten/created:

//! @param start_size - The initial space to be allocated for a file if it is
//!                     being created
